Master's Project Management System. This is a team project for the course Human-Computer Interface Design at California State University, Sacramento.
Team members - Rajasekhar Reddy Kolagotla, Kundana Bala Sai Sree Lingala, Aravind Yuvraj, Nithin Gogineni
The main aim of this project is to smooth line the process of a Master's Project with an easy and accessible interface for the students of California State University, Sacramento.
Initially, we developed an application suitable for mobile devices, where students can access the portal, but later found that a website would be more useful than a mobile application.
All the team members contributed their work equally and the documents and discussions that we went through are uploaded and can be accessible here.
